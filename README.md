In this Chrome extension, we implemented four policies that can be toggled by the user. 

- Policy 1: Isolate HTTP and HTTPS Cookies
- Policy 2: Prevent Cookie Overwriting (path)
- Policy 3: Prevent Cookie Shadowing (domain)
- Policy 4: Stop User Tracking (Facebook)

Once load the chrome extension and click it, it will open a new tab in Chrome.
In the top bar, there are four toggle buttons to on/off each policy. 
In the body, the left column is to list all the request history. 
The right column dispalys the sent-out cookie before and after the policy is toggled.
